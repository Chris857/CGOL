# synth components.rle
A collection of synthesis components intended to be useful for synthesizing still lifes and oscillators. For each small still life, oscillator, and active region, each synthesis is grouped by the directions that gliders and XWSSes come from and whether they are colliding with a target. Syntheses were gathered from the https://conwaylife.com/ forums and wiki, syntheses on Catagolue (https://catagolue.hatsya.com/), Mark Niemiec's Life Page (https://conwaylife.com/ref/mniemiec/lifepage.htm), various databases of 3G / 4G / octohash / octo3obj syntheses, and serendipitious findings by accident or from colliding gliders in Seeds of Destruction.

Organization is still a work in progress, but is roughly sorted into still lifes, oscillators, and active regions (such as LOM, R-pentomino, etc.).

The overall collection is saved in LifeHistory. For each synthesis, there is a collection of state 1 gliders and XWSSes with a state 4 display of the final resulting pattern. To the right shows the reaction envelope of the synthesis, at a fixed number of generations later indicated for each synthesis (typically a multiple of 40 generations i.e. 40gen, 80gen, 120gen, etc.).

Feel free to use these syntheses for any purpose.
